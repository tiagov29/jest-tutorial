Why you should test?
- Goal: check whether an applicacions behaves as expected
- safeguard against unwanted behaviour when changes are made
- automated, and thus efficient on the long-term

Have a test priority (example):

1. high value features
2. Edge cases in high value features
3. things that are easy to break
4. Basic react component testing
    - User interactions
    - Conditional rendering
    - Utils / hooks
